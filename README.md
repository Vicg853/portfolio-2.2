### **General info**
Hi ðŸ‘‹! This is my personal portfolio that I usually update every year (thus I'll probably change this repo's name later). 

The website is generated using NextJS (opted for it instead of Gatsby) SSG and some of the pages use ISG/SSR for some content to be displayed. 

Hope you like it ðŸ˜„!

### **Technologies**
