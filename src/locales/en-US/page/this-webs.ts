      pageDescription: 'Although I often ingress in third-party projects, my most remarkable one, which will never stop evolving, is my laboratory or as I call it the: ‚Äútumex-project‚Äù.\n\nCurrently, it only features this website and a couple of backend services hosted on Railway.app and Vercel... but I have bigger plans for it. I plan on building a self-managed Kubernetes cluster, that will provide a wide range of features (CI/CD environments, hosting, LXD VMs, etc).\n\nFrom that, I‚Äôll probably develop storage services (a.k.a. google drive alternative), other useful services (e.g.: VPN), whole-home automation from scratch, a Jarvis-like A.I., and anything that comes to mind\n\nThe biggest advantage/reason of it all?\n\nI get to experience near-production original environments, solve challenges, broaden my knowledge and also have fun on the way. All without causing no one/no company any harm.',
